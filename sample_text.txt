What is Clojure?

Clojure is a functional programming language that features a concise syntax,
elegant concurrency support and frictionless Java integration.

Clojure’s approach to programming enables you to write most of your
applications’ code as series of pure functions, each one operating only on the
immutable values passed in. Since pure functions have no side-effects they are
easy to understand, easy to test, and are inherently thread-safe. On top of
that, Clojure provides a rich set of features that allow threads to coordinate
state changes in a consistent, controlled fashion.

Clojure's Lisp based syntax is incredibly easy to learn: Most programmers can
pick up the basics in an afternoon. It is also very concise, which means you
spend less time typing and more time designing.

Finally, Clojure is designed from the ground up to work seamlessly on the
Java Virtual Machine. Clojure compiles to Java bytecode, can use any existing
Java jar file, instantiate any Java class, and call any Java method.
Interoperability is built into the syntax, making it easy to write code that
interacts with Java.
